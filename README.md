# landing-page

In doing this project, I applied the flexbox skills that I have been reviewing recently. I built fluency with flexbox, developing an intuition for how it affects the flow of the page. I also demonstrated my ability to tackle a complex design problem by breaking it down into its component parts.

This is not the most complete this project could be; I could return to this project later and clean up the rough edges. There are some page width/scroll issues I have yet to figure out, and there is no original content in place, only the styling. In the future, if I get the inspiration, I may return to this page and flesh it out with content.
